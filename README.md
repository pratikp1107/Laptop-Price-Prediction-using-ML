# Laptop-Price-Prediction-using-ML
*Pattern Recognition and ML Project*
## Description:
In todayâ€™s modern world, Laptops are a very crucial part in the daily lives of every single person, whether it be a student, a businessman, a working professional or even even in fields apart from academics e.g. Gaming. As laptops are really compact and easy to carry anywhere it makes them a preferred choice over any other gadget. In this project we are going to apply various Machine Learning Algorithms to accurately predict the price of laptops based on several features.

This project deals with predicting laptop prices training and implementing various machine learning models such as:
1) Linear Regression
2) Ridge Regression
3) Lasso Regression
4) Decision Trees and 
5) Random Forest Algorithms.
